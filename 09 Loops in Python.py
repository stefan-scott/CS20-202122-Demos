# While and For Loops
# Mr. Scott
# Dec 16. 2021
# Two main types of loops in Python

# Conditional,  Counting

# Counting by Twos 0 - 40 with conditional

# current_number = 0
# while current_number <= 40:
#     print(current_number)
#     current_number = current_number + 2

# Counting Loops

# for current_num in range(10):
#     print(current_num)
    
#  for                 i            in      range(5)
# loop keyword   loop variable             [0, 1, 2, 3,4]

# repeat 5:  REEBORG
#      
# for i in range(5):   #PYTHON
#     print("aaa")
    
    
# for fruit in ["apple", "banana", "mango", "pear"]:
#     print(fruit)

province = "Saskatchewan"
for letter in province:
    print(letter)
