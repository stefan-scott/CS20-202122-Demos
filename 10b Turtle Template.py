# A first foray into using the Turtle library

import turtle       # looks for a file called turtle.py
                    # it will look in the lib  folder
                    # but it will look in the same folder as this program
                    # first
                    
# create and setup a window object
window = turtle.Screen()



# create at least one turtle object
roscoe = turtle.Turtle()
